# Hey, I'm Marcelo! 👋 🙋 🇵🇪

I am a software engineer at Bloomberg where I work in Enterprise Data org, specifically validating Index data. I am a graduate from Johns Hopkins University where I studied Computer Science and Applied Math. I like learning and building stuff, especially web and mobile applications.

# Previously... 💼 🏡 💻
I worked at Mastercard in the Commericla Solutions org. Also, I interned at Google twice, where I worked at Filestore and Google Nest products respectively. I interned at CodeLabs for the summer of 2020, part of the non-profit group CodeDay, which pairs up students with mentors from leading tech companies to work on open-source projects over the summer.Finally, I interned at Bank of America for the summer of 2019 as a FinTech Focus fellow.


# In my free time...🌐 🌳  🎥
I make websites and do web design for fun.
I like being outdoors. On the weekend, you can catch me jogging, playing soccer, or swimming when it is nice out.
I enjoy watching movies. I am big fan of Quentin Tarantino and have watched all of his movies multiple times. Feel free to message me for movie recommendations.
