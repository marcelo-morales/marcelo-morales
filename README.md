# Hey, I'm Marcelo! 👋 🙋 🇵🇪

I am a sophomore at Johns Hopkins University double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Math. I like learning and building stuff, especially web applications and mobile applications.

# Previously... 💼 🏡 💻
I interned at CodeLabs for the summer of 2020, part of the non-profit group CodeDay, which pairs up students with mentors from leading tech companies to work on open-source projects over the summer.
I interned at Bank of America for the summer of 2019 as a FinTech Focus fellow.


# In my free time...🌐 🌳  🎥
I make websites and do web design for fun.
I like being outdoors. On the weekend, you can catch me jogging, playing soccer, or swimming when it is nice out.
I enjoy watching movies. I am big fan of Quentin Tarantino and have watched all of his movies multiple times. Feel free to message me for movie recommendations.

# Personal/School/Hackathon projects...🏫 ✏️ 👨‍💻
Feel free to browse my GitHub profile for any project that I have worked on or currently working on. I appreciate any feedback and if you any awesome ideas, I would love to collaborate!
